<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> is not just another meme coin.  
It’s a delicious fusion of a hamster’s relentless appetite, the rich smoothness of butter, and the warmth and satisfaction of freshly baked bread — all baked into one irresistible, uncontrollable craving.

Our philosophy is simple and bold: we bake — three times a day, or even thirty.  
But baking is more than just production. It’s a process of building value together, kneading passion and creativity with our community into something greater.

<strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> is more than fun — it’s a next-generation meme coin that combines charm with utility and paves the way for sustainable growth.  
Beneath its adorable appearance lies an unstoppable hunger, relentless effort, and the power of a warm and welcoming community — coming together to shape a world that only <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> can offer.

Even now, we’re baking. And we won’t stop. Louder, hotter, crispier — the sound of <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> baking will echo far and wide.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>2. Lore</h2>
  <p>According to legend, the <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> species once faced a dire crisis — a catastrophic shortage of butter.  
  In those days, butter was more than just a food item; it was a vital resource that determined their survival and prosperity. Without it, the very existence of <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> was at risk.

  Yet in the face of despair, the Hambubters did not give in.  
  Instead, they rose with a bold vision — to build a Kingdom of Baking on the blockchain, a place where hope could rise like warm bread from the oven.

  This kingdom became more than a digital realm; it evolved into an innovative ecosystem where the community gathers to bake, protect, and grow their shared values.

  Out of this movement, the Gluttony DAO was born — a force that embodies the will of the Hambubter species and continues to battle against the No-Butter Alliance.  
  The No-Butter Alliance represents scarcity and instability, threatening the peace and prosperity of the Baking Kingdom.

  But the true source of Hambubter’s power lies in <strong>HBUB</strong> — the <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> token.  
  It is not merely a crypto asset, but the very fuel that powers the Kingdom of Baking, strengthened each day by the community’s passion and participation.

  Even now, the <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> and their allies continue to grow, challenge, and rise — using <strong>Hambubter [$HBUB]</strong> as their beacon, overcoming the wounds of the butter crisis and marching boldly into a new era of abundance.

  This is the legend of the Hambubter Kingdom — and the future we will bake together.</p>

  <h2>3. Tokenomics</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Token Symbol:</strong> HBUB<br />
    <strong>Total Supply:</strong> 100,000,000,000 HBUB
  </p>
  <p>
    At the heart of the Hambubter ecosystem lies the <strong>HBUB token</strong>.  
    Designed as the core engine for the project’s stability and long-term growth, <strong>HBUB token</strong> has a total supply of 100 billion tokens — ensuring ample liquidity and scalability.

    More than just a meme coin, <strong>HBUB token</strong> is crafted as an innovative crypto asset combining functionality, community engagement, and economic utility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, the token supply is designed to decrease gradually through an automatic burn mechanism,  
    which increases scarcity and value over time.  
    This burn process is directly linked to baking activities within the <strong>HBUB token</strong> ecosystem, naturally driving the token’s value as the community continues to grow and bake together.

<div class="section">
  <h2>4. Utility</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>HBUB token</strong> plays a vital role in the Hambubter ecosystem, serving a wide range of practical functions and driving community engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than just a means of exchange, the <strong>HBUB token</strong> is designed as a dynamic engine for participation, growth, and the long-term sustainability of the Hambubter project.  
    It forms the economic backbone of the ecosystem, empowering both users and investors to actively contribute in various ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, <strong>HBUB tokens</strong> are essential ingredients for minting limited-edition Hambubter NFTs.  
    This allows token holders to become more than just investors—they can own and interact with unique digital assets that represent iconic elements of the Hambubter universe.  
    These NFTs symbolize exclusive status within the community, enhancing trust and a sense of belonging among holders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, <strong>HBUB</strong> features an automatic burn mechanism triggered by failed "baking" attempts (e.g., unsuccessful transactions or ecosystem events).  
    When such failures occur, a portion of HBUB tokens is automatically burned, reducing the overall token supply and helping to preserve its long-term value.  
    This mechanism reinforces the project’s commitment not only to growth, but also to stability and sustainable development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, HBUB serves as a governance token within the Hambubter DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).  
    Token holders gain voting rights, allowing them to directly influence major project decisions—such as voting on what type of bread to bake next.  
    This participatory model reflects Hambubter's core philosophy: the community isn’t just an audience, but an active co-creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, <strong>HBUB token</strong> is required for participating in community events and reward programs.  
    These initiatives not only provide economic incentives but also strengthen bonds among users, contributing to a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Used for NFT Minting:</strong> HBUB tokens are required to mint limited-edition Hambubter NFTs.  
      This gives holders the chance to own unique digital assets and gain special recognition within the ecosystem.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automatic Burn on Failed Baking:</strong> If a baking process (e.g., certain transactions or actions) fails, HBUB tokens are automatically burned.  
      This naturally reduces the supply and helps protect the token’s value over time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DAO Voting Power:</strong> HBUB functions as a governance token in the Hambubter DAO.  
      Holders can vote on key decisions, including fun ones like choosing which bread to bake next.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Participation in Community Events:</strong> HBUB is needed to join various events and reward programs.  
      This encourages active involvement and helps foster a lively, close-knit community.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In this way, HBUB is far more than just a digital asset — it’s a vital force that empowers the entire Hambubter community to grow, evolve, and realize a shared vision.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>5. Burn Mechanism</h2>
  <p>
    Every ingredient that isn’t baked will eventually spoil.  
    In the <strong>Hambubter[$HBUB]</strong> ecosystem, failed NFT combinations are automatically burned—just like butter melting away and disappearing.  
    This burn process acts as a core mechanism for regulating the <strong>HBUB token</strong> supply and plays a crucial role in enhancing its scarcity and preserving its value.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than just a deflationary tactic, this mechanism lays the foundation for a healthy ecosystem cycle and sustainable growth.  
    Tokens and NFTs that fail during the baking process or become redundant are systematically burned to prevent oversupply in the market, contributing to the overall stability of token value within the community.  
    In essence, <strong>Hambubter’s</strong> <strong>“butter-melt burn”</strong> is an essential pillar supporting the project’s long-term success.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>6. Roadmap</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Hambubter project</strong> roadmap presents a clear set of goals and phased action plans, offering ongoing trust and value to the community and investors.  
    Each quarterly milestone is designed to drive the project's growth and ecosystem expansion, laying the groundwork for Hambubter’s long-term vision.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Q1:</strong> Launch of the official HBUB token alongside a foundational website.  
      This provides users with easy access to essential project information and helps establish initial community trust.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q2:</strong> Release of unique NFTs to be used within the Hambubter ecosystem, paired with a meme competition to spark community engagement.  
      This phase encourages direct participation and creativity among supporters.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q3:</strong> Begin development of a fun, interactive meme-themed game, while activating the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).  
      This empowers the community to take part in project governance and decision-making, reinforcing a decentralized structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Q4:</strong> Launch exclusive HambubterBurger merchandise in collaboration with various partners.  
      This initiative aims to boost brand recognition, strengthen community identity, and establish new revenue streams.

  </ul>
  <p>
    Through this roadmap, Hambubter aims to go beyond the limitations of typical meme coins, building an innovative blockchain ecosystem that delivers both utility and fun.
