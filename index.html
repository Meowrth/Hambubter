  <!-- PHILOSOPHY SECTION -->
  <section class="section" id="philosophy">
    <h2>World Philosophy</h2>
    <p><strong>Hambubter [HBUB]</strong> is more than just a meme character.<br />
      He is a <strong>greedy little hamster who always craves bread and butter</strong> and a reflection of us investors, chasing infinite possibilities.</p>
    <p>He may look round and cute, but his world is structured and logical.<br />
      A hunger for <strong>real profits</strong> as fierce as his appetite,<br />
      a <strong>value preserving structure</strong> as stable as rich butter,<br />
      and a <strong>community driven ecosystem</strong> that bakes and shares daily—these are what make <strong>Hambubter</strong> more than just a meme, but a <strong>practical crypto asset.</strong></p>
    <blockquote><strong>“Spread it. Toast it. Earn it!”</strong></blockquote>
    <p>This slogan isn’t just a joke—it’s the core philosophy of the <strong>Hambubter [HBUB]</strong> ecosystem.</p>

      <li><strong>Two slices of bread represent liquidity</strong>—a solid market anyone can buy and sell in freely.</li>

      <li><strong>Hambubter [HBUB]</strong> is the perfect blend—a fusion of community, economy, memes, and practicality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Hambubter [HBUB]</strong> goes beyond fun and laughter.<br />
      It achieves a harmony of memes and tokenomics through mechanisms like <strong>automatic burns</strong> to reduce supply,<br />
      and a <strong>reward structure that brings real benefits to participants</strong>.</p>
    <p>Don’t be fooled by the cuteness.<br />
      <strong>HBUB is a next-gen meme coin born from a serious ecosystem with high-calorie potential for growth.</strong></p>
