# 🐹 Hambubter ($HBUB) - Too Hungry to Stop

Hambubter is the legendary meme coin born from the fusion of hamster, butter, and bread.  
This project goes beyond mere humor — it’s a community-driven Web3 experiment where **the philosophy of hunger** meets **blockchain technology**.

> **"We bake. Three times a day, sometimes thirty-three."**

## 🧠 Overview

According to legend, the Hambubter tribe founded a new kingdom of baking on the blockchain following the **Great Butter Shortage**.  
Fueled by HBUB, we bake, mint, and burn under the name of the Appetite DAO.

## 🔥 HBUB Token

- **Name**: Hambubter

- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000,000 HBUB

### 🧩 Utility

- Voting power in the DAO (e.g., what kind of bread to bake)
